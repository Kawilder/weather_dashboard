## About The Project
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
